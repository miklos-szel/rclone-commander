Rename app_config.ini to rclone-commander.ini

Rename the application configuration file from app_config.ini to
rclone-commander.ini for better consistency with the project name.

Changes:
- Renamed config files in config/ and src/rclone_commander/config/
- Updated all code references in src/rclone_commander/config.py
  - get_app_config_path() search paths and documentation
  - load_app_config() docstring
  - get_user_app_config_path() path and documentation
- Updated documentation in README.md and CLAUDE.md
  - Config file locations and search priority
  - Configuration examples and instructions
  - Troubleshooting references
- Updated run.sh script to use new filename
- Updated all docs/ markdown files
- Updated build artifacts (PKG-INFO, SOURCES.txt)

The new config file locations are:
1. ~/.config/rclone-commander/rclone-commander.ini (user config)
2. <package>/config/rclone-commander.ini (bundled default)
3. config/rclone-commander.ini (legacy location)

This change improves naming consistency across the project and makes
the config file more immediately recognizable as belonging to
rclone-commander.
